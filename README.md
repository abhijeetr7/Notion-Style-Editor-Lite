# Notion-Style-Editor-Lite

This Notion-Style Editor Lite provides a clean interface for managing your notes.

Key Features:

Rich-text Editing: Use the toolbar buttons for bold, italic, highlights, headings, and lists.

Markdown Support (Basic): While the editor primarily uses rich-text, it has basic logic to interpret **bold**, *italic*, and [[Page Title]] for internal linking.

Tagging: Type #yourtag anywhere in your note, and the tags will automatically be extracted and appear in the sidebar for filtering.

Page Linking: Type [[Page Title]] to create internal links between your notes. You can also use the link button in the toolbar. The editor will suggest existing page titles as you type in the link modal.

Note Management: Create new notes, open existing ones by clicking their titles in the sidebar, and delete notes.

Auto-Save: Your notes are automatically saved to your browser's local storage as you type.

Download: Download the current note as an HTML file, preserving its formatting.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Ctrl/Cmd + B: Bold

Ctrl/Cmd + I: Italic

Ctrl/Cmd + S: Save notes

Ctrl/Cmd + K: Open link modal

Ctrl/Cmd + N: Create a new note
